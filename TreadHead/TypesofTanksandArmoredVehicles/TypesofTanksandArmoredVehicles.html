        <h3 id=mediumTank>Medium Tank</h3>
            <p>Since the advent of the tank until the end of WWII it was difficult to have all three aspects of <a href="../index.html#TheTrinity">the Trinity of Tank Design</a> 
            combined into one tank.  Most tanks could only have 2 of the 3 elements.  Medium tanks are designed to be as balanced as possible, they neither excel in nor 
            completely lack any of the three aspects.  Their battlefield role is general, they attack the enemy, they rampage behind his lines, and they defend from enemy attacks.  
            Some of the most famous medium tanks from WWII are the <a href="T-34-76andT-34-85.html">T-34-76 and T-34-85</a>, <a href="M4Sherman.html">M4 Sherman,</a> and 
            <a href="Pz.IV.html">Pz. IV</a>.

        <h3 id=MBT>Main Battle Tank (MBT)</h3>
            <p>The British Centurion A41, revealed in 1945, was the first tank considered a Main Battle Tank.  The Soviet T-54/55 followed shortly.  The role and characteristics of 
            the Main Battle Tank are similar to the Medium tank, but at the end of WWII due to advances in engine power, armor, and guns it became possible to have a high level of all 
            three elements of the trinity of tank design.  Using only one kind of tank rather than several simplified development, production, training, and logistics without sacrificing
            too much capability.  This meant that the previous classes of light tank and heavy tank became mostly obsolete, as an MBT could compete with a light tank 
            in mobility, a heavy tank in armor, and a tank destroyer in firepower.  As a result, the WWII classifactions of light, medium, and heavy tank became largely obsolete; 
            all replaced by the MBT.  There are still some examples of modern light tanks, and what could be considered equivalents to tank destroyers in specilized roles, usually 
            these vehicles are meant to be air transportable to support airborne troops, or amphibious to support amphibious landings.  Some notable examples of MBTs include the 
            Leopard 2, M1A2 Abrams, T-72, and K-2 Black Panther.</p>

            <h3 id=heavyTank>Heavy Tank</h3>
            <p>Compared to a medium tank, heavy tanks are unbalanced.  They emphasize protection and firepower at the expense of mobility.  These tanks are intended to break strong enemy defences 
              medium tanks would hesitate to attack, and they're well suited to take on other heavy tanks.  Some famous examples of heavy tanks are the IS-2, Tiger 1, and KV-1.

          <p>Light tanks sacrifice protection for mobility and firepower, they especially emphasize mobility.  These tanks are intended to outmanuver the enemy, scout, and exploit 
            opportunities heavier tanks create.  A few examples of light tanks include the M3/M5 Stuart, Pz. 1, the BT series of tanks, and the T-26.

          <p>The main role of Amphibious Tanks is to land on beaches to support offensive landing operations, and they can also cross rivers that might stop other tanks allowing them 
            to keep up the offensive or surprise the enemy.  Some good examples of amphibious tanks include the LVT, DD Sherman tanks, and (more modern) the PT-76, and Type 63.

          <a id=tankDestroyer><h3>Tank Destroyer</h3></a>
          <p>Tank destroyers are designed to do exactly that: destroy tanks.  Tank destroyers usually have great firepower at the expense of protection and mobility.  Many tank 
            destroyers in WWII didn't have turrets, the gun was in the hull and the whole tank had to be turned to aim the gun more than a few degrees to the sides. This kind of 
            turretless arrangement is called a casemate.  Some good examples of tank destroyers are the Stug III, Jagdpanther, the ISU and SU series, the M10, and the M18.

            <h3>Armored Personnel Carrier (APC)</h3>
          </a>
          <p>
            APCs are designed to move infantry or any cargo to and around the battlefield in relative safety.  They typically only have machine guns or small caliber cannons, and 
            enough armor to stop rifle caliber bullets and shell or bomb fragments.  APCs are not expected to fight with the infantry, only move them around.  Some APCs are the 
            M3 Half-Track, Universal Carrier, Sd.Kfz. 251, M113, and BTR.

            <h3>Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV)</h3>
          </a>
          <p>IFVs are similar to APCs, they transport infantry around the battlefield; but IFVs are designed to fight with the infantry and support them.  IFVs have better protection 
            and firepower than APCs, but still far less than a tank.  The Soviets introduced the first IFV in the form of the BMP-1, Western powers soon copied this concept and 
            created their own IFVs.  Some examples of IFVs include the BMP, Marder, and Puma.

            <p>Armored cars have a similar level of firepower, protection, and mobility to light tanks but as the name suggests they have wheels, not tracks.  As a result they will 
              have worse performance in soft ground but they can drive long distances much more quickly and they're easier to maintain.  Some examples of armored cars are the 
              M3-Scout Car, M8-Greyhound, Sd.Kfz. 234, and the BRDM.

            <p>Self-Propelled Artillery are howitzers, mortars, or rocket launchers mounted on a tracked vehicle often with enough armor to stop rifle caliber bullets and shrapnel.  
              They look similar to tanks but their guns are optimized for long range indirect fire not direct fire, and in some cases may even be unable to fire at something 
              if it's too close.  Some examples of Self-Propelled Artillery include the Wespe, M7-Priest, M108, and 2S3 Akatsiya.

          <p>Assault Guns are intended to use their mounted large caliber guns to support infantry with direct fire and they often have heavy or medium protection.  
            Assault Guns can be classified as self-propelled artillery despite being incapble of indirect fire, and in some cases served double duty as tank destroyers, 
            most notably the Stug. III, SU series, and ISU series.  Some good examples of assault guns are the aformentions Stug. III, SU series, and ISU series as well as the Churchill AVRE and 
            M4 105mm Howitzer.</p>

            They're designed to travel with tanks, APCs, and IFVs and protect them from enemy aircraft.  Some examples of these include the Wirbelwind, Gepard, and Tunguska.
