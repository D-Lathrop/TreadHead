                <h2>What is a tank?</h2>
                    <p>The only definition of a tank that doesn't have any exceptions is that a tank is a tank if the army that uses it plans to use it as a tank.</p>
                    <p>A more meaningful definition is that a tank should have the following design features:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Treads or tracks</li>
                    <li>An independently rotating turret with a direct-fire weapon optimized for ground targets</li>
                    <li>Enough armor to at least stop rifle bullets from the front</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>There are some vehicles that have all of these features but are still not tanks, for example 
                    <abbr title="Infantry Fighting Vehicle"><a href="TypesofTanksandArmoredVehicles/TypesofTanksandArmoredVehicles.html#IFV"> 
                    IFVs,</a></abbr> <abbr title="Armored Personel Carrier"><a href="TypesofTanksandArmoredVehicles/TypesofTanksandArmoredVehicles.html#APC"> APCs,</a></abbr> and 
                    some <a href="TypesofTanksandArmoredVehicles/TypesofTanksandArmoredVehicles.html#tankDestroyer"> tank destroyers.</a>  
                    This is because a tank is intended to fulfill a specific role on the battlefield.  This role is to attack the enemy line, breakthrough, and exploit that 
                    breakthough to encircle the enemy, or wreak havoc behind their line.  <abbr title="Infantry Fighting Vehicle">IFVs</abbr>, 
                    <abbr title="Armored Personel Carrier">APCs</abbr>, and tank destroyers don't have this role.</p>
                    <p>An example of a tank model that lacks one of these features is the Swedish STRV series of tanks that don't have a turret.  Although some might disagree 
                        the Swedish army considers the STRV series tanks.
                    </p>

                <a id="TheTrinity"><h3>The Trinity</h3></a>
                    <p>When discussing tanks most documentaries, webpages, and commentators will focus on 3 criteria called the Trinity of Tank Design.</p>
                    <p>The first of these is firepower.  Usually this is measured by how much steel armor a tank's gun can penetrate in millimeters.  
                    Secondary guns such as machine guns and smaller cannons, reload speed, muzzle velocity, and the explosive mass of the gun's shells may also be considered.</p>
                    
                    <p>The second element of the trinity is armor, or protection.  This is usually measured by how thick the tank's steel armor is in millimeters on the front of 
                    the turret and hull.  Modern tanks use armor technology that's far better than hardened steel, for modern tanks the thickness of steel that would be needed to 
                    provide the same level of protection as its actual armor is calculated and this number is used.  For example, a modern tank might be described as having the 
                    equivalent of 800mm of armor, but the actual physical thickness of the tank's armor is only 400mm.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>The third element of the trinity is mobility.  This is most commonly expressed in a tank's top speed.  Some other factors include the tank's power to weight 
                    ratio, ground pressure per square inch, total weight, and how far it can drive before refuelling.
                    </p>
                    <p>While all of these elements are important there are many more elements to consider when designing or evaluating a tank; some of these elements can be the 
                    saving grace of designs that otherwise seem bad, or ruin designs that seem great on paper.
                    </p>

                </div>

                <h3>Ergonomics</h3>
                    <p>Some of the key aspects of ergonomics include how much space the crew has inside the tank, how noisy it is inside, the volume of engine fumes or gunpowder 
                    fumes that are inside, and even how easy it is to drive.

                </div>

                <h3>Sensors, Sights, and Awareness</h3>
                  
                    <p>Another aspect of tank design that often goes unmentioned is how easily and clearly the crew can see the world outside the tank.  This aspect is influenced by 
                    the periscope and vision slit design, optics, and sensors.  The best gun in the world is useless if you can't find a target.
                    </p>
                  
                <h3>Survivability</h3>

                    <p>While this aspect may sound like a synonym of protection, it's not quite the same.  Protection focuses on how difficult it is to penetrate the armor.  
                    Survivability focuses on how likely it is the crew will survive if the armor is penetrated.  Two of the main aspects that influence survivability are how easy it 
                    is to bail out, helped by larger or more quickly opened hatches, and how likely it is the ammunition inside the tank will be set alight burning or blowing up the 
                    crew.  Some methods for reducing the risk of an ammunition fire include hatches that will blow off allowing the force and heat to be directed up away from the crew, 
                    and storing ammunition in jackets of water that will douse the ammunition if punctured.
                    </p>
                  
                <h3>Ease of Maintenance and Repair</h3>

                    <p>Tanks break down.  Every tank will need repairs and maintenance, often on the battlefield.  How easily and quickly a tank can be repaired and maintained is an aspect 
                    of tank design that often goes unappreciated.  One of the main aspects of this is how easy it is to remove and replace parts.  On the M4 Sherman for example, an armor 
                    piece on the front of the hull can be unbolted, and the transmission removed and replaced quickly.  In contrast, on tanks without this feature removing the entire turret 
                    and much of the interior may be necessary to replace the transmission.
                    </p>
                  
                <h3>Ease of Manufacture</h3>

                    <p>The age old question: quantity or quality?  We won't attempt to answer that question here but no one would disagree that the best path is to have both.  This is why 
                    ease of manufacture is another important element in tank design.  Some tanks are more complex than others, with higher manufacturing tolerances and more parts, this added 
                    complication may not provide a big enough boost in performance to justify the increased cost, production time, and maintenance time.</p>
                  
                <h3>A Balanced Look is Needed</h3>

                    <p>A good example of a tank that looks great on paper, but isn't quite so great in reality due to the aspects above is the T-34-76.  The gun, armor, top speed, and 
                    suspension of the T-34-76 were all very good for their time.  Sometimes the T-34-76 proved to be a real problem for the German army, even to the point of rendering their standard 
                    anti-tank gun useless. However the T-34-76 had a lot of problems.  There was only a commander and gunner in the turret.  The commander had to load the gun as 
                    well as command the tank, and try to keep an eye on the situation outside the tank, all while making decisions that might cost him his life.  To make matters 
                    worse he had no cupola, only a periscope.  The T-34-76 also had small hatches that were difficult to get out of, meaning the crew were less likely to escape 
                    their burning tank in time.  The transmission was also very stiff, even to the point of sometimes requiring a hammer to force the tank to change gears.  It's 
                    not hard to imagine that the crew of a T-34-76 wouldn't be able get as much performance out of their tank as its stats would suggest.
                    </p>
